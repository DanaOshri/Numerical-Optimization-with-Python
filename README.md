# Numerical-Optimization-with-Python


1. Implement Gradient Descent iterative algorithm, Newton and Quasi-Newton methods for unconstrained minimization.
2. Add step size selection at each iteration according to the backtracking Wolfe conditions.
3. Implement interior point method for small constrained optimization problems.
4. Test it on several examples and get some impression of its behavior and some drawbacks.
5. Extend our plotting and monitoring of iterative algorithms, so we can monitor the decrease in function values and the rate of convergence.
